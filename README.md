## Abstract

This article reviews key text-mining capabilities of the R language and proposes methodologies for improvements to text mining large volumes of content, especially email, and novel analytics and visualizations that will enhance the understanding of the content of a corpus. This article builds on existing R-language text-mining APIs to suggest more meaningful and readable analytical capabilities and visualizations. Assuming a general familiarity with the R language, the article starts by looking at baseline capabilities of text mining APIs, and gives examples of enhanced data-cleaning, normalization, data augmentation and visualization methodologies. The aim is to develop a more deliberate process for deriving more relevant information from unstructured data and email in particular. This article is intended as a preliminary study of several promising concepts; further research can to prove out quantitative efficacy of these methods in commercial applications.
